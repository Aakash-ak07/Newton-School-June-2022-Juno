<!-- Let's build the game of Rock, Paper and Scissors! (Learn game here).

This is how you may proceed:


Take number of turns in a game from the user ( an input box of type number ).

Start the game when the user clicks the play button.

User can select (Rock, Paper, Scissors ) from clickable DOM object ( such as button, div, image etc )

You have to keep count of User Points, Computer Points, turns left and result of the round. You have to show what computer chooses as text

If there's no round left then show game result

Do Not hide input box and play button

Show the round Result after each round

6. Use “rounds-left”, “user-points”, and “computer-points” attribute-values for rounds left, user points, and computer points respectively which renders the number of round-left, user-points, and computer-points, and Update them after each round.
