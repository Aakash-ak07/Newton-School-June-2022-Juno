<!-- In this project, we will be a simple todo app, but saving them to local storage.

So it shows the items we have added even after refreshing the page.

The HTMl markup is already set up for you, you just need to implement the js part.

When user clicks #add-todo button it adds the todo(which is written in input#todo-input) to ul#todo-holder element.

Also upon refreshing, all previously added todos, should be displayed in the ul#todo-holder element.

Note:- Use localstorage. All individual todo items to be displayed in li tags inside ul -->

<body onload="loadTasks()">
    <input id="todo-input">
    <button id="add-todo" >Add todo</button>
    <ul id="todo-holder">
    </ul>
</body>
